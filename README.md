# Turtle_Games_Analysis

Through the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator, I completed a project which used data on a fictional global gaming company to provide recommendations on how it can improve its loyalty scheme and future marketing campaign.

**üïπÔ∏è Background**

Turtle Games is a global gaming company, supplying own brand as well as other brandproducts. They have collected data on their existing customers, how they interact with the loyalty points scheme and reviews, and want to use evidence to improve both their marketing and loyalty scheme.

**‚ùì Problem Statement**

Turtle Games wants to maintain and expand its dominance in the global gaming market, in order to increase sales and ultimately profit. To do so, To survive in the market, they need to avoid churn of existing customers by improving the loyalty scheme, and expand their customer base by offering better products and services than competitors.

**üë©‚Äçüíª Analytical Approach**

Research Questions: 
1) What are the characteristics of the existing customer base?
2) What are the drivers of loyalty points (and spend score) and how should the scheme be improved?
3) How should the marketing campaign target high value new customers and high value existing customers at risk of churn?

Approach: 
* One dataset was used, which provided customer details, incl. age, spend score, loyalty points and recent review of the product.
* Python analysis included: exploratory analysis, K-Means clustering to identify customer groups, regression and decision tree analysis to determine the drivers of loyalty points.
* R analysis included: exploratory analysis, statistical testing to confirm Python findings, regression analysis, interactive visualisations.
